Full Project Prompt: OCR-Based Document KYC System

I am building an OCR-based document KYC system that extracts textual data from Aadhaar cards using a YOLOv8 model. I want to develop this as a web-accessible application capable of handling high loads (1000 requests per minute). I need the system to be robust, scalable, and production-ready, while following best practices for ML engineering and software development.

Project Vision & Goal

The app allows users to upload an Aadhaar image, automatically preprocess it, and feed it into a YOLOv8 model.

The YOLO model detects 5 predefined labels on the card and optionally crops the corresponding regions.

The output is textual JSON, providing label names, detected text, confidence scores, and coordinates.

The app should be fast, scalable, and maintainable, supporting production-level deployment.

Current Tech Stack

Backend/API: Flask (Python)

Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow, NumPy

Containerization & Deployment: Docker + Gunicorn + Nginx, scalable via Kubernetes or cloud services

Versioning & Tracking: Git for code, DVC/S3 for model weights

Testing: Pytest for automated testing

Environment Management: Python venv (or conda)

Monitoring: Logs, latency, error rate, model performance tracking

Key Best Practices

Environment: work_env/ lives in the project root; ignored in Git.

Version Control:

Git tracks code, configs, docs, sample images.

Large files like YOLO weights are stored in DVC or cloud storage.

Use model_registry.json to manage model versions.

Testing: tests/ ensures preprocessing, inference, and APIs work correctly.

Deployment:

Preload model in memory to avoid reload on each request.

Use Gunicorn workers + Docker + Load Balancer for scaling.

Optional: Async queue (Celery + Redis) for heavy jobs.

Security & Privacy:

.env stores secrets, not tracked.

No sensitive Aadhaar images pushed to GitHub.

Monitoring & Maintenance: Track latency, error rate, model performance, data drift, and retrain as needed.

Request Flow

User uploads Aadhaar image → hits /predict endpoint.

preprocessing.py cleans and formats the image → returns a tensor.

inference.py runs YOLOv8 → detects labels, optionally crops regions.

Results formatted (via utils.py) → JSON returned to user:

{
  "Name": {"text": "XXXX", "confidence": 0.95, "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},
  "DOB": {"text": "XX-XX-XXXX", "confidence": 0.92, "bbox": [...]},
  ...
}

GitHub Strategy

Push: app/ code, tests/, .gitignore, README.md, requirements.txt, configs, sample images.

Ignore: work_env/, model weights, datasets, .env, logs.

Add selective files via git add <file> or rely on .gitignore.

Future Enhancements

Add a frontend (React/Angular) for web access.

Add OCR post-processing to clean extracted text.

Add multi-document support for batch processing.

Integrate monitoring dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana).

Add role-based access for security compliance.
